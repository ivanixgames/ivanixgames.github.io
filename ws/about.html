<section>
<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>Greetings. I am a technologist with over twenty years of experience, having served in various roles such as software developer, IT consultant, project manager and on to director of software engineering.  I have also worn a few other hats at more than one startup.</p>
<p>At heart, I am a student of life. I marvel at how things work, whether those found in nature or those made by man. As a child, I enjoyed taking things apart to see what made them tick. I learned to build things from erector sets, legos, tinker toys and later electronic kits.  Over the years, I have become a jack of all trades with interests in many areas. </p>
<p>One thing that has stood out is my enjoyment of building something new, whether it&#39;s a software app or a physical gadget.  With so many ideas waiting to be explored, I came to realize that my best return is to build for others.</p>
<p>I founded Ivanix Mobile as a way to channel my passions and skills for the benefit of other aspiring entrepreneurs,  while affording me a freer and more fulfilling lifestyle.  If you are looking for someone to help develop your startup&#39;s idea into a working prototype or need help taking it to the next level, I warmly welcome the opportunity to talk with you.</p>
