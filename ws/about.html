<section>
<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>On the CV side, I am a software technologist with over twenty years of experience, having served in various roles ranging from  field engineer, software developer, IT consultant, project manager and director of software engineering.  I have also worn a few other hats in more than one startup.</p>
<p>At heart, I am a student of life. As a young child, I marveled at how things work, whether those found in nature or those engineered by man. I enjoyed taking things apart to see what made them tick. I would build functional items from electronic kits, erector sets, legos and wooden puzzles.   As I branched into new areas, I became a jack of all trades, gaining some skills such as software development, graphics design, electronics, mechanical,  wood working, home remodeling, and even baking. </p>
<p>In recent years, I worked on several DIY projects of my own design. Most were for my own needs and amusement, but others were ideas for new commercial products or startup opportunties.  With so many new ideas waiting to be explored, I came to the conclusion that my knack for building prototypes would be put to better use if shared with others.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I founded Ivanix Mobile as a way to channel my passions, skills and experience for the benefit of other aspiring entrepreneurs,  while affording me a freer and more fulfilling lifestyle.  If you are looking for someone to help develop your startup&#39;s idea into a working prototype or need help taking it to the next level, I warmly welcome the opportunity to talk with you.</p>
